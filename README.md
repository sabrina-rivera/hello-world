About Me 

I’m a detail‑driven analyst with a strong foundation in data validation, compliance review, and documentation management, shaped by my experience in regulated laboratory environments. 
I bring a unique blend of analytical thinking, technical skills, and clear communication—using tools like SQL and statistical methods to turn complex information into accurate, actionable insights. 
I’m motivated by continuous learning, process improvement, and the opportunity to contribute meaningful value through data‑driven decision‑making.
